Image Processing Techniques
This repository covers fundamental image processing techniques using various algorithms to manipulate, analyze, and extract information from images. The techniques involve operations that enhance image quality, detect boundaries, segment objects, and more.

Basic Operations in Image Processing
1. Image Enhancement
Contrast Adjustment: Improves image clarity by modifying the contrast.
Brightness Adjustment: Alters the overall lightness or darkness of an image.
Histogram Equalization: Enhances contrast by adjusting the image's histogram.
2. Filtering
Smoothing/Blurring: Reduces noise and fine details in the image (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filter).
Sharpening: Enhances edges and fine details using filters like Laplacian or Sobel.
3. Edge Detection
Identifies significant changes in intensity or color, highlighting the boundaries of objects.
Common methods: Sobel Operator, Canny Edge Detection.
4. Geometric Transformations
Resizing: Adjusts image dimensions.
Rotation: Rotates the image by a given angle.
Translation: Shifts the image within space.
5. Thresholding and Segmentation
Thresholding: Converts an image to binary based on a specific threshold.
Segmentation: Divides an image into regions based on properties like color or intensity.
Edge Detection and Contour Detection
Edge Detection
Purpose: To detect boundaries between objects and their backgrounds by identifying sharp intensity or color changes.
Output: A binary image highlighting edges as white pixels (255) and non-edges as black pixels (0).
Contour Detection
Purpose: Detects and organizes object boundaries into continuous curves or closed shapes.
Output: A list of points representing the object's boundary, often used for object recognition or further analysis.
Techniques: In OpenCV, the cv2.findContours function detects contours from a binary image.
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Simply import the desired functions from the library, and follow the examples in the documentation to apply image enhancement, filtering, edge detection, and contour detection on your images.
